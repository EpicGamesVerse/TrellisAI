# TrellisAI (Tipico)

Windows-friendly fork of TRELLIS with a Gradio UI entrypoint in `tipico_trellis.py`.

## Quickstart (Windows)

1) Clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EpicGamesVerse/TrellisAI.git
cd TrellisAI
```

2) Create a venv (Python 3.11 recommended):

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -U pip
```

3) Install dependencies and local wheels:

```sh
python install.py
```

4) Download models into a local folder named `models` (so the UI can load them):

```sh
huggingface-cli download bigchu/trellis_ai --local-dir models --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

5) Run the UI:

```sh
python tipico_trellis.py --precision fp16
```

## What you should keep in the README

- Attribution to the upstream TRELLIS project and paper (below).
- The license section(s) describing how the code/submodules are licensed.
- The citation block (recommended by the upstream authors).

<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> is a large 3D asset generation model. It takes in text or image prompts and generates high-quality 3D assets in various formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. The cornerstone of <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> is a unified Structured LATent (<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">SL</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">AT</span>) representation that allows decoding to different output formats and Rectified Flow Transformers tailored for <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">SL</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">AT</span> as the powerful backbones. We provide large-scale pre-trained models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> significantly surpasses existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales, and showcases flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models.



<!-- Features -->
## 🌟 Features
- **High Quality**: It produces diverse 3D assets at high quality with intricate shape and texture details.
- **Versatility**: It takes text or image prompts and can generate various final 3D representations including but not limited to *Radiance Fields*, *3D Gaussians*, and *meshes*, accommodating diverse downstream requirements.
- **Flexible Editing**: It allows for easy editings of generated 3D assets, such as generating variants of the same object or local editing of the 3D asset.



<!-- Installation -->
## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **System**: The code is currently tested only on **Linux**.  For windows setup, you may refer to [#3](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/3) (not fully tested).
- **Hardware**: An NVIDIA GPU with at least 16GB of memory is necessary. The code has been verified on NVIDIA A100 and A6000 GPUs.  
- **Software**:   
  - The [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) is needed to compile certain submodules. The code has been tested with CUDA versions 11.8 and 12.2.  
  - [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install) is recommended for managing dependencies.  
  - Python version 3.8 or higher is required. 

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EpicGamesVerse/TrellisAI.git
    cd TrellisAI
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    
    **Before running the following command there are somethings to note:**
    - By adding `--new-env`, a new conda environment named `trellis` will be created. If you want to use an existing conda environment, please remove this flag.
    - By default the `trellis` environment will use pytorch 2.4.0 with CUDA 11.8. If you want to use a different version of CUDA (e.g., if you have CUDA Toolkit 12.2 installed and do not want to install another 11.8 version for submodule compilation), you can remove the `--new-env` flag and manually install the required dependencies. Refer to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) for the installation command.
    - If you have multiple CUDA Toolkit versions installed, `PATH` should be set to the correct version before running the command. For example, if you have CUDA Toolkit 11.8 and 12.2 installed, you should run `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.8/bin:$PATH` before running the command.
    - By default, the code uses the `flash-attn` backend for attention. For GPUs do not support `flash-attn` (e.g., NVIDIA V100), you can remove the `--flash-attn` flag to install `xformers` only and set the `ATTN_BACKEND` environment variable to `xformers` before running the code. See the [Minimal Example](#minimal-example) for more details.
    - The installation may take a while due to the large number of dependencies. Please be patient. If you encounter any issues, you can try to install the dependencies one by one, specifying one flag at a time.
    - If you encounter any issues during the installation, feel free to open an issue or contact us.
    
    Create a new conda environment named `trellis` and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    . ./setup.sh --new-env --basic --xformers --flash-attn --diffoctreerast --spconv --mipgaussian --kaolin --nvdiffrast
    ```
    The detailed usage of `setup.sh` can be found by running `. ./setup.sh --help`.
    ```sh
